# mpcTracking

MPC(Model predictive control) is widely used in robotics. this work uses MPC for path tracking of a two-wheeled differential cart in a simulation environment,and it is made to adapt to any path.

this work is based on turtle3(which support simulation sources) and osqp-eigen. Therefore, for you to be able to use this work correctly, please note the following points:

- it only work on ubuntu20.04, with ros-noetic
* ensure download all submoudles correctly
+ ensure your osqp-eigen lib is installed properly
- check all the path(maybe noetic path,lib path and so on)

## How it works? 
task1 is a simple work to test your env is right. It is implemented to allow the cart model to travel to a set position, which is, of course, entered by the keyboard,with a simple pid controller. Just run it to test.
        $roslaunch task1_pkg turtle3_test.launch
Obviously, task2 is the "protagonists", it

## How to use it?


There is currently no launch file written to start all nodes, you may need to do this manually, follow these stepsï¼š
1. go to the main folder

        $ cd path/to/work
1. maybe you should re-build it
   
        $ catkin_make
1. import the model name, and start up Gazebo,you could try other model like waffle,but it means you should modify the code to support different robot model.
   
        $ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
        $ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch
1. start up Rviz
   
        $ rviz -d ./src/task2_pkg/rviz/mpctracking.rviz
1. start mpc control node, and you may get some INFO in screen, and model will move.
   
        $rosrun task2_pkg control

## How to redevelop it?

For simple redesign, you only need pay attention to creatPath() in control_node.cpp, setWeightMatrices() and setInequalityConstraints() in mpc.cpp. it is very easy to resetting the path and adjusting the parameters of the controller.
