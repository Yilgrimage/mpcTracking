# mpcTracking
## Background
MPC(Model predictive control) is widely used in robotics. this work uses MPC for path tracking of a two-wheeled differential cart in a simulation environment, and it is made to adapt to any path.

this work is based on [turtle3](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/)(which support simulation sources) and [osqp-eigen](https://github.com/robotology/osqp-eigen), you may get more infomation in their website. Btw if you are new for MPC, you should learn it quickly in [Model Predictive Control](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1HQ4y1P7bJ/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=9ccc920bc6359b6c70aeb81313354624)(but please note the difference between models), after that you may understand how it works. There is other site teach you how to [cast MPC to QP](https://robotology.github.io/osqp-eigen/md_pages_mpc.html) with osqp-eigen.

## Install
 for you to be able to use this work correctly, please note the following points:

- it only work on ubuntu20.04, with ros-noetic-fulldesktop.
* ensure download all submoudles correctly
+ ensure your osqp-eigen lib is installed properly
- check all the path(noetic path,lib path and so on)

It is easy to configuration environment, you can find comprehensive and correct installation guide in their Github Page or stackflow.



## Usage
### How to use it?
task1 is a simple work to test your env is right. It is implemented to allow the cart model to travel to a set position, which is, of course, entered by the keyboard,with a simple pid controller. Just run it to test.

        $roslaunch task1_pkg turtle3_test.launch
About task2, there is currently no launch file to start all nodes automatically for some reason, you may need to do this manually, follow these stepsï¼š
1. go to the main folder

        $ cd path/to/work
1. maybe you should re-build it
   
        $ catkin_make
1. import the model name, and start up Gazebo,you could try other model like waffle,but it means you should modify the code to support different robot model.
   
        $ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
        $ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch
1. start up Rviz
   
        $ rviz -d ./src/task2_pkg/rviz/mpctracking.rviz
1. start mpc control node, and you may get some INFO in screen, and model will move.
   
        $rosrun task2_pkg control

### How to redevelop it?

For simple redesign, you only need pay attention to _creatPath()_ in _control_node.cpp_, _setWeightMatrices()_ and _setInequalityConstraints()_ in _mpc.cpp_. it is very easy to resetting the path and adjusting the parameters of the controller.
